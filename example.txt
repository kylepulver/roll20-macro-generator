# Each macro generates a prompt for any bonuses
# If you with to disable this, put this at the
# start of the file:
config: prompts = off
# This will not disable MAP or Heightened prompts
#
# Starting a macro with the words:
# * skills
# * ability
# * saves
# Will perform a special action, so don't name other
# macros those words!
#
# When you run the python script, it will read all
# text files in its directory, and output new files
# with the roll20 macros in them.
#
# Don't use the > character in places other than the
# start of a new macro.
#
# For a strike use any of the following words
